# World Economic Indicator - Data Analysis Project

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is creating a department under its name which will focus on how a country can attain sustainable growth. This organisation hires you as a data analyst for this department to determine which factors a country should focus on to sustain GDP/ Capita.

Now, they provide you with the dataset ( World Economic Indicator Dataset), which has different countries and regions' GDP, population, and other factors that might impact GDP/Capita. Using Data Analysis methods, develop a solution that can be referred to as "how a country can attain sustainable growth ".

Dataset: https://tinyurl.com/j2tuwj8a

SOLUTION:

• I have conducted data analysis on the many variables included in the dataset and their impact on the country's GDP per capita. After joining the databases into a single list, we imputed missing information using a unique identifier and VLOOKUP.

• Since the information provided is specific to a nation and area for a year and cannot be
considered as a whole for all the countries, the imputation approach employing aggregated
methods/zero value is not applied.

• The entry is left blank for the analysis if the prior year value of the missing element is likewise missing.

• The outliers are present in the dataset but not taken into consideration for our analysis.
